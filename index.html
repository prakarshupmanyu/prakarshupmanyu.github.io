      <h2>Projects</h2>
      <b>Abstractive French article summarization</b>
      <ul>
        <li>An encoder-decoder system that creates an abstract summary of a French news article. It was trained using 446,000 French news articles scraped from websites like www.lemonde.fr, www.latribune.fr, etc.</li>
        <li>The model was trained using Recurrent Neural Networks with LSTM units.</li>
        <li>The generated summary received a FRESA score of 0.08-0.21. Further details can be found <a href="https://github.com/prakarshupmanyu/news-in-short">here</a>.</li>
      </ul>
      <b>Mini Prolog</b>
      <ul>
        <li>This is a <a href="https://github.com/prakarshupmanyu/MiniProlog">tool</a> that compiles sentences in First Order Logic. I wrote a compiler using PLY library in Python. The processed statements were added to a knowledge base for information extraction.</li>
        <li>Using the knowledge base, the tool could tell us whether a new statements is inferable or not. It gives answer in True/False.</li>
        <li>The system had a 96% accuracy to infer new sentences that were humanly inferable from any given knowledge base.</li>
      </ul>
      <b>Language Detector</b>
      <ul>
        <li><a href="https://github.com/prakarshupmanyu/LanguageDetector">This tool</a> trains a model using Naive Bayes with Laplace smoothing method. I used <a href="http://www.statmt.org/europarl/">europarl corpus</a> as the training set.</li>
        <li>The model is then used to predict the language of given text. It can predict any of the 10 languages that were used while training.Further details can be found <a href="https://github.com/prakarshupmanyu/LanguageDetector">here</a></li>

      <h2>Research</h2>
      <b>Lesion Detection in Brain Scans using Deep Networks</b> (Ongoing)
      <ul>
        <li>Currently working under the supervision of <a href="https://viterbi.usc.edu/directory/faculty/Leahy/Richard">Prof. Richard M Leahy</a> to find a suitable approach to detect lesions in brain MRI using deep neural networks.</li>
        <li>This is a big application of Fully Convolutional Neural Networks with some modifications to it.</li>
        <li>The idea for this is to extend this research to other medical domains where you can further identify anomalies in different parts of the body.</li>
      </ul>
      <b>Defect Collection and Reporting System</b>
      <ul>
        <li>Under the supervision of <a href="http://www.dtu.ac.in/Web/Departments/CSE/faculty/ruchikam.php">Dr. Ruchika Malhotra</a>, researched the error-prone area of defect prediction and change proneness duringmy final year of bachelors. It included the empirical analysis of the Object Oriented Metrics and also, the comparison of Modelling methods for Software Fault Prediction.</li>
        <li>Accomplished this by developing an integrated tool that would automate the process of software defect data collection and report generation for Git based software. Research paper on this tool titled “<a href="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6954234/?reload=true">Defect Collection and Reporting System for Git based Open Source Software</a>” was published in IEEE Xplore during ICDMIC, 2014</li>
